                    <h2>Chunin Exams</h2>
                    <p>The exams are a chance for ninja to be promoted from genin to chunin. The tests also serve as a chance for the various ninja villages to spy on each other. Kakashi has his team sign up to compete.

                        Sasuke, Sakura, and Naruto are put through a series of exams that push them to their limits. All three have a near-death experience at some point during the exam. The exams also prove to be a changing point for Sasuke. As a result of his experiences, he decides to leave the village forever.

                        <p>Another flashback from Shippuden shows another mission with Team 7. Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are sent to recover a golden statue that had been stolen. Sasuke and Naruto end up with their dominant hands trapped and stuck together.

                            The two have to find a way to work together and save a captured Sakura. The two genin have to show incredible teamwork skills to save their friend. In the end, Sasuke and Naruto find out they will be stuck together for a few days.

                        <p>When Gaara is introduced, he is full of anger and rage. His encounter with Naruto sends him on a different path. In an episode of Shippuden, a flashback shows Gaara volunteering to team up with a group from Konoha.

                            Team 7, along with Gaara and a couple of Sand Ninja, are dispatched to deal with a border dispute. Gaara has to work to earn the trust of those around him. His teammates distrust him because of his status as a jinchuriki while Team 7 is shocked to see how much Gaara has changed since they last saw him during the events of the Chunin Exams.

                            <p>Team 7 is brought together for the first time since Sasuke left. Naruto and Sakura are given a chance to see their lost teammate for the first time in years. Team 7 has been reborn with Yamato filling in for Kakashi and Sai taking over for Sasuke.

                                Sasuke proves that he has become stronger than both Naruto and Sakura. Sai seems to be the only one who stands a chance at defeating the rogue ninja. Naruto and Sakura fail in their mission to get Sasuke to return to Konoha.
