# Finding Minimum and Maximum in a List

This repository contains different approaches to find the minimum and maximum values in a list of integers.

## Approaches

### Approach 1: Manual Iteration

In this approach, we manually iterate through the list to find the minimum and maximum values. We use temporary variables initialized to the maximum and minimum values that the system can handle.

#### Complexity
- Time Complexity: \(O(n)\)
- Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)

### Approach 2: Using Sorting

Here, we sort the list first and then pick the first and last elements as the minimum and maximum, respectively.

#### Complexity
- Time Complexity: \(O(n \log n)\)
- Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)

### Approach 3: Using Built-in Functions

In this approach, we use Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the list.

#### Complexity
- Time Complexity: \(O(n)\)
- Space Complexity: \(O(1)\)
