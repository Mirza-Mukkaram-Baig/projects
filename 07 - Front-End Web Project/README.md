# Front-End Web Project

This repository contains the code for a front-end web project. The project appears to be related to the popular anime series "Naruto," as several image files are named after characters from the series.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: This is likely the main entry point of the web application.
- `main.css`: This file contains the main CSS styles for the web application.
- `login.css`: This file likely contains the CSS styles for a login page or component.
- `app.js`: This JavaScript file likely contains the main logic for the web application.
- Image files: The project contains several `.jpg` and `.png` files that are likely used within the web application.
- `Front End Project.rar`: This file appears to be a compressed archive of the project.

## Running the Project

As this is a front-end project, you should be able to run it by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.
